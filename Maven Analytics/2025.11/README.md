# 🚀 Maven Space Challenge — Space Missions Dashboard (Power BI)

![Dashboard Preview](./110c5ab9-1ea4-49e3-98ee-72986bcf333a.png)

## 🌌 Overview  
This project was created for the **Maven Analytics – Return to Space Challenge**, where participants were asked to design a compelling and insightful dashboard using real-world space mission data.

Using **Power BI**, I designed an interactive dashboard that allows users to explore decades of space missions, analyzing patterns across rockets, companies, launch sites, mission outcomes, and even launch schedules.
